Mainly used dynamic programming and median coordinates (tps effect seems better) to calculate the correspondence between points

The direct mapping used in the construction of the depth map did not use the method in the paper (first find the edge points, and then use the least squares to solve the internal point depth value)

The obtained 3d model effect is not good
